1. Where in the literature did you find the formula for regularising the z-score? Doing google search only returns me the standard formula. Is the concept always about tuning the variance?

2. What are other common types of distributions that we should try? Have you encountered any cyber analytics related examples where it does not make sense to use normal distribution?

3. I find it hard to understand concept of EVT and the implementation code. Can you give a run-through?
