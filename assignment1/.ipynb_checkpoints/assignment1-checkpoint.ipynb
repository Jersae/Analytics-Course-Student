    "Welcome to the first machine problem of the data analytics course! \n",
    "\n",
    "This machine problem is designed to introduce you to some of the fundamental tasks faced by data analysts on a day-to-day basis.\n",
    "On a higher level, these tasks include:\n",
    "1. Data ingestion\n",
    "2. Data processing, transformation and enrichment\n",
    "3. Data visualization\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, this machine problem assumes that you have the pre-requisites of python under your belt, meaning you understand:\n",
    "- python data types\n",
    "- python [data structures](https://docs.python.org/3.5/tutorial/datastructures.html) (such as list, dict and tuple)\n",
    "- python [control flows](https://docs.python.org/3.5/tutorial/controlflow.html) (if-else and for-loops)\n",
    "- how to declare, build and call [python functions](https://docs.python.org/3.5/tutorial/modules.html)\n",
    "- how to find help in [python documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/index.html) and [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)\n",
    "\n",
    "If the above python concepts sounds alien to you, please read up on them in the python documentation. There is no shortcut around a solid foundation in programming in data analytics.\n",
    "\n",
    "We know that this machine problem subsequent homeworks will be a challenging, but the struggle is part of the learning process. When stuck, please proactively ask questions on [Piazza](https://piazza.com/), do a google search, or refer to some of the code already written as examples on how things are done. Happy learning!"

As you can see from above, the logs are in **unstructured** format, meaning they come as free text. These data were originally collected more for humans to read than for machines to analyse.

    "## Part 2: Data Processing with Pandas <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"process\"></a>\n",
    "As described in its own documentation:\n",
    "[**Pandas**](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/index.html) is a Python package providing fast, flexible, and expressive data structures designed to make working with “relational” or “labeled” data both easy and intuitive. It aims to be the fundamental high-level building block for doing practical, real world data analysis in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "As left off in Problem 1, the data is now represented in a Pandas DataFrame.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, we still can't really work with this data because the data types of every column are strings! We should at least convert timestamp to a datetime datatype. You will also notice that the IP and ports are still together. We will need to separate them out.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Problem 2, you will need to:\n",
    "1. Separate port from ```src_ip``` and ```dst_ip``` columns\n",
    "1. Convert timestamp column into ```DateTimeIndex``` datatype\n",
    "2. Make timestamp into the index of Pandas Dataframe\n",
    "3. Drop timestamp column which has become redundant after making it the index.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hint: Lambda functions and the apply method\n",
    "In Pandas DataFrame, there is a neat built in function called apply(). We can pass it a function to run that function on every row in the DataFrame. For example:\n",

    "## Congratulations!\n",

    "You have built your first data driven application that provides insights into SNORT IDS logs. While it's level of \"usefulness\" is subjective and depends on the opinion of your boss, you can pat yourself on the back for developing something that helps user answer the following question:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. For a particular asset in my network, what are the threats as identified by the IDS?\n",
    "2. Is a threat persistently happening over a period of time? Or is it just a one time event?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Before the fun begins, the bulk of the work lies in data ingestion and data preprocessing.\n",
    "2. Always try to store all ingested data with a schema and/or data structure. Centralized data storage in a data lake is ideal for convenient future data analytics work.\n",
    "3. Data visualization is one of the (but not the only) tools of data analytics. Use it well.\n",
    "4. IPython Notebook is a powerful application. You can use it for data storytelling or even build interactive applications with plotly and ipython widgets.\n",
    "5. Pandas is the de-facto tool for data analysis on structured data. For unstructured data, it is more open ended.\n",
    "5. A lot of insights can be gained without machine learning. Sometimes the information is already in the data. Just filter, transform and aggregate!\n",
    "\n",
    "With point 5 said, you now have to basics to dive into more complex data analytics with machine learning next week."
